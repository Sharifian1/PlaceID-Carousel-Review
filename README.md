A responsive, dynamic carousel that fetches real Google Reviews using the **Google Places API**. Built with **Vanilla JavaScript, Express.js, and CSS**, this project demonstrates frontend-to-backend integration, responsive design, and clean code practices.

## Installation & Setup  

Clone the repo:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/reviews-carousel.git
cd reviews-carousel
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the server:

node server.js
```

Open http://localhost:5500 in your browser

## How It Works

1. The Express backend provides a /reviews endpoint that fetches data from the Google Places API.
2. The frontend JS (index.js) calls /reviews asynchronously.
3. Reviews are dynamically inserted into the DOM and displayed in a carousel.
4. Media queries adjust the layout to show 2 reviews on mobile or 4 on desktop.
5. Navigation buttons update the current review index and re-render the carousel.
